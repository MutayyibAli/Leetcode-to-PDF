<div class='ai-explanation'><p>The problem asks us to remove all occurrences of a specific value <code>val</code> from an array <code>nums</code> in-place. We must return <code>k</code>, the number of elements remaining in the array after removal. The order of the first <code>k</code> elements doesn't matter, and the values beyond the <code>k</code>-th element are also not important. This problem can be efficiently solved using a two-pointer technique.</p>
<h3>Explanation of Approaches</h3>
<p>There are two primary two-pointer approaches to solve this problem. Both are optimal in terms of time and space complexity but differ in implementation details and the number of element assignments they perform.</p>
<h4>Approach 1: Two Pointers (Slow and Fast)</h4>
<p>This is a very common and intuitive approach. We use two pointers: a "slow" pointer <code>k</code> and a "fast" pointer <code>i</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The fast pointer <code>i</code> iterates through the entire array from beginning to end.</li>
<li>The slow pointer <code>k</code> marks the position for the next element that is <strong>not</strong> equal to <code>val</code>. It starts at index 0.</li>
<li>As the fast pointer <code>i</code> traverses the array, if it encounters an element <code>nums[i]</code> that we want to keep (i.e., <code>nums[i] != val</code>), we copy this element to the position of the slow pointer: <code>nums[k] = nums[i]</code>.</li>
<li>After the copy, we advance the slow pointer <code>k</code> to the next available position.</li>
<li>If <code>nums[i]</code> is the value to be removed, we simply advance the fast pointer <code>i</code>, effectively ignoring the element.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the loop completes, <code>k</code> will hold the count of the remaining elements, and the first <code>k</code> elements of <code>nums</code> will be the elements we kept. This approach preserves the relative order of the elements that are not removed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> <code>O(N)</code>, where <code>N</code> is the number of elements in the array. Both the slow and fast pointers traverse the array at most once.</li>
<li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> <code>O(1)</code>, as the modifications are done in-place without using any extra space.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Approach 2: Two Pointers (Optimized for Few Removals)</h4>
<p>This approach is slightly different and can be more efficient in terms of write operations if the number of elements to be removed is small.</p>
<ul>
<li>We use a pointer <code>i</code> starting from the beginning of the array and a variable <code>n</code> which represents the effective size of the array, initialized to its original length.</li>
<li>The pointer <code>i</code> iterates through the array. When <code>nums[i]</code> is equal to <code>val</code>, we want to remove it.</li>
<li>Instead of shifting elements, we replace <code>nums[i]</code> with the last element of the current effective array, <code>nums[n-1]</code>.</li>
<li>Then, we decrement <code>n</code> to shrink the effective size of the array. We do <strong>not</strong> increment <code>i</code> in this step because the newly placed element at <code>nums[i]</code> (which came from the end) also needs to be checked.</li>
<li>If <code>nums[i]</code> is not equal to <code>val</code>, we simply move on by incrementing <code>i</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The loop continues until <code>i</code> catches up with <code>n</code>. The final value of <code>n</code> is the new length <code>k</code>. This method changes the original order of the elements.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> <code>O(N)</code>. Both pointers <code>i</code> and <code>n</code> traverse the array at most once.</li>
<li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> <code>O(1)</code>, as it's an in-place algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first approach is generally preferred for its simplicity and for preserving the relative order of the kept elements, making it the "best" solution in terms of clarity and common practice.</p>

<h1>include <vector></h1>
<p>class Solution {

    int removeElement(std::vector<int>&amp; nums, int val) {
        // k is the index where the next element not equal to val should be placed.
        int k = 0; </p>
<pre><code>    // Iterate through the array with index i.
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; nums.size(); ++i) {
        // If the current element is not the one to be removed...
        if (nums[i] != val) {
            // ...place it at the k-th position.
            nums[k] = nums[i];
            // Move the placeholder for the next valid element.
            k++;
        }
    }

    // k is the new length of the array.
    return k;

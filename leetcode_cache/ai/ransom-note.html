<h3>1. Brute Force Approach</h3>
<p>This naive approach involves iterating through each character of the <code>ransomNote</code>. For each character, we search the entire <code>magazine</code> string to find a match. If a match is found, we must "use up" that character from the <code>magazine</code> to prevent it from being used again. This can be done by replacing it with a special symbol. If we iterate through the entire <code>magazine</code> and cannot find a match for the current <code>ransomNote</code> character, it's impossible to construct the note, and we return <code>false</code>. If we successfully find a match for every character in the <code>ransomNote</code>, we return <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>This method is highly inefficient due to the repeated searching within the <code>magazine</code> string.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">class Solution {
public:
    bool canConstruct(string ransomNote, string magazine) {
        for (char r : ransomNote) {
            bool found = false;
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; magazine.length(); ++i) {
                if (magazine[i] == r) {
                    magazine[i] = '#'; // Mark as used
                    found = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!found) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(n * m), where n is the length of <code>ransomNote</code> and m is the length of <code>magazine</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(1) if modifying the input string is allowed, otherwise O(m) to store a copy.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>2. Sorting Approach</h3>
<p>A more efficient approach involves sorting both strings alphabetically. After sorting, we can use a two-pointer technique to determine if <code>ransomNote</code> can be constructed. One pointer (<code>i</code>) tracks our position in <code>ransomNote</code>, and another (<code>j</code>) tracks our position in <code>magazine</code>. We advance the <code>magazine</code> pointer (<code>j</code>) to find a character that matches the character at <code>ransomNote[i]</code>. If <code>magazine[j]</code> is the same as <code>ransomNote[i]</code>, it means we found a required character, so we advance both pointers. If <code>magazine[j]</code> becomes greater than <code>ransomNote[i]</code>, it means the <code>magazine</code> does not contain the required character, so we return <code>false</code>. If we successfully match every character in <code>ransomNote</code> (i.e., <code>i</code> reaches the end), we return <code>true</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

class Solution {
public:
    bool canConstruct(string ransomNote, string magazine) {
        std::sort(ransomNote.begin(), ransomNote.end());
        std::sort(magazine.begin(), magazine.end());

        int i = 0; // pointer for ransomNote
        int j = 0; // pointer for magazine

        while (i &lt; ransomNote.length() &amp;&amp; j &lt; magazine.length()) {
            if (ransomNote[i] == magazine[j]) {
                i++;
                j++;
            } else {
                j++;
            }
        }

        // If we have found all characters for the ransom note
        return i == ransomNote.length();
    }
};
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(m log m + n log n) due to sorting.</li>
<li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(log m + log n) to O(m + n), depending on the space used by the sorting algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>3. Frequency Counter (HashMap) Approach</h3>
<p>This approach counts the frequency of each character in the <code>magazine</code>. We use a hash map (or <code>unordered_map</code> in C++) to store characters as keys and their counts as values. First, we iterate through the <code>magazine</code> and populate the map. Then, we iterate through the <code>ransomNote</code>. For each character in the <code>ransomNote</code>, we check if it exists in our map and has a count greater than zero. If it does, we decrement its count, signifying that we've "used" one instance of that character. If the character is not in the map or its count is already zero, the <code>magazine</code> doesn't have the required character, and we return <code>false</code>. If the loop completes, it means all characters in the <code>ransomNote</code> were found in sufficient quantities, and we return <code>true</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;unordered_map&gt;

class Solution {
public:
    bool canConstruct(string ransomNote, string magazine) {
        std::unordered_map&lt;char, int&gt; magazineCounts;

        // Count characters in the magazine
        for (char c : magazine) {
            magazineCounts[c]++;
        }

        // Check if ransomNote can be constructed
        for (char c : ransomNote) {
            if (magazineCounts.find(c) != magazineCounts.end() &amp;&amp; magazineCounts[c] &gt; 0) {
                magazineCounts[c]--;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
};
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the strings.</li>
<li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(k), where k is the number of unique characters. Since there are only 26 lowercase English letters, this is effectively O(1).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>4. Frequency Counter (Array) Approach</h3>
<p>This is an optimization of the hash map approach. Since we know the strings only contain lowercase English letters, we can use a simple array of size 26 as a frequency map instead of a more complex hash map. The index <code>0</code> of the array will correspond to 'a', <code>1</code> to 'b', and so on. We first iterate through the <code>magazine</code> to populate the frequency counts in the array. Then, we iterate through the <code>ransomNote</code>, decrementing the count for each character. If at any point a character's count in the array drops below zero, it signifies that the <code>ransomNote</code> requires more of that character than the <code>magazine</code> provides, so we return <code>false</code>. If we successfully process the entire <code>ransomNote</code>, we return <code>true</code>. This is the most optimal approach.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

class Solution {
public:
    bool canConstruct(string ransomNote, string magazine) {
        if (ransomNote.length() &gt; magazine.length()) {
            return false;
        }
        std::vector&lt;int&gt; counts(26, 0);

        // Count characters in magazine
        for (char c : magazine) {
            counts[c - 'a']++;
        }

        // Check characters for ransomNote
        for (char c : ransomNote) {
            counts[c - 'a']--;
            if (counts[c - 'a'] &lt; 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
};
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the strings.</li>
<li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(1), as the array size is fixed at 26.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Pythonic Solution (Best Approach)</h3>
<p>The most Pythonic way to solve this utilizes the <code>collections.Counter</code> class, which is a specialized dictionary for counting hashable objects. We can create counters for both the <code>ransomNote</code> and <code>magazine</code>. Subtracting one counter from another keeps only the elements from the first counter that were not "covered" by the second. If the result of <code>Counter(ransomNote) - Counter(magazine)</code> is an empty counter, it means every character needed for the ransom note was available in the magazine. An empty counter evaluates to <code>False</code> in a boolean context, so we return the negation.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from collections import Counter

class Solution:
  def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -&gt; bool:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Checks if ransomNote can be constructed from magazine using character counts.

    The logic relies on collections.Counter. When one Counter is subtracted 
    from another, it keeps only elements with positive counts from the first 
    Counter. If ransomNote can be constructed, all its character requirements 
    are met by magazine, so the subtraction will result in an empty Counter.
    An empty dictionary/Counter is &quot;falsy&quot;, so `not` of it becomes `True`.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    return not (Counter(ransomNote) - Counter(magazine))

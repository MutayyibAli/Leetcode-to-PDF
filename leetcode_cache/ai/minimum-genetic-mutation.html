<h3>Brute Force Approach (DFS)</h3>
<p>This approach models the problem as a graph traversal and uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore every possible mutation path from <code>startGene</code> to <code>endGene</code>. We use a recursive function that tries to move from the current gene to any valid, unvisited gene in the bank that is one mutation away. A global variable keeps track of the minimum mutation count found so far. To avoid getting stuck in cycles, we use a <code>visited</code> set for the current path, and we backtrack by removing the gene from the set after exploring all its neighbors. While this approach can find a solution, it's not guaranteed to be the shortest path unless all paths are explored, which is highly inefficient.</p>
<p>The time complexity is exponential in the worst case, as it may explore a large number of paths, roughly O(N!), where N is the number of genes in the bank. The space complexity is O(N*L) for the recursion stack and the visited set, where L is the length of the gene string.</p>

<h3>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</h3>
<p>This problem can be perfectly modeled as finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. The gene strings (<code>startGene</code> and the genes in <code>bank</code>) are the nodes, and an edge exists between two nodes if they are one mutation apart. Breadth-First Search (BFS) is the ideal algorithm for this, as it explores the graph level by level, guaranteeing that the first time we reach the <code>endGene</code>, it will be through the minimum number of mutations.</p>
<p>The process starts by adding the <code>startGene</code> to a queue with a distance of 0. We use a set or map to keep track of visited genes to avoid redundant processing. In a loop, we dequeue a gene, find all its valid neighbors (unvisited genes in the bank that are one mutation away), and enqueue them with an incremented distance. The search ends when the <code>endGene</code> is reached or the queue is empty.</p>
<p>The time complexity is O(N^2 * L) where N is the number of genes in the bank and L is the length of a gene string, because for each of the N genes, we might iterate through the entire bank. The space complexity is O(N * L) to store the queue and visited information.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;queue&gt;
#include &lt;map&gt;

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
  int minMutation(string start, string end, vector&lt;string&gt;&amp; b) {
    // A map to store the distance from start and also acts as a visited set.
    map&lt;string, int&gt; dist;
    dist[start] = 0;

    // Queue for the BFS traversal.
    queue&lt;string&gt; q;
    q.push(start);

    while (!q.empty()) {
      string u = q.front();
      q.pop();

      // Iterate through every gene in the bank to find potential neighbors.
      for (const string&amp; v : b) {
        // If this gene has already been visited, skip it.
        if (dist.count(v)) continue;

        // Check if gene 'v' is one mutation away from gene 'u'.
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 8; i++) {
          if (u[i] != v[i]) {
            cnt++;
          }
        }

        if (cnt == 1) {
          // If it's a valid mutation, record its distance and add it to the queue.
          dist[v] = dist[u] + 1;
          q.push(v);
        }
      }
    }

    // After the BFS, if the end gene is in our distance map, return its distance.
    // Otherwise, it was not reachable, so return -1.
    if (dist.count(end)) {
      return dist[end];
    } else {
      return -1;
    }
  }
};

<h3>Pythonic Solution (Best Approach - BFS)</h3>
<p>The most pythonic and often efficient BFS approach generates all possible one-character mutations from the current gene and checks if they exist in the <code>bank</code>. This avoids iterating through the entire bank for each gene. We use a <code>deque</code> for an efficient queue and sets for O(1) average time complexity lookups of the <code>bank</code> and <code>seen</code> genes. This strategy is particularly effective when the gene length and alphabet size are small, while the bank size could be large.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def minMutation(self, startGene: str, endGene: str, bank: list[str]) -&gt; int:
        # Use a set for efficient O(1) lookups.
        bank_set = set(bank)
        if endGene not in bank_set:
            return -1

        # Queue for BFS: stores (current_gene, number_of_mutations)
        queue = deque([(startGene, 0)])
        # Set to keep track of visited genes to avoid cycles.
        seen = {startGene}

        while queue:
            current_gene, mutations = queue.popleft()

            if current_gene == endGene:
                return mutations

            # Try changing each character of the current gene.
            for i in range(len(current_gene)):
                # Try all possible characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'.
                for char in &quot;ACGT&quot;:
                    if current_gene[i] == char:
                        continue

                    # Form the new mutated gene string.
                    next_gene = current_gene[:i] + char + current_gene[i+1:]

                    # If the new gene is valid (in bank) and not seen, process it.
                    if next_gene in bank_set and next_gene not in seen:
                        seen.add(next_gene)
                        queue.append((next_gene, mutations + 1))

        # If the queue becomes empty and we haven't found the endGene, it's not possible.
        return -1

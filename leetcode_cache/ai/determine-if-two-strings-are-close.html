<h3>Brute Force Approach</h3>
<p>A brute-force solution would involve simulating the operations. We would start with <code>word1</code> and try to generate all possible strings that can be reached through any combination of Operation 1 and Operation 2, and then check if <code>word2</code> is one of them.</p>
<p>However, this is computationally infeasible. Operation 1 allows for any permutation of the string, which can be up to N! possibilities. Operation 2 allows for swapping character identities, which adds another layer of combinatorial explosion. Given the constraints (string length up to 10<sup>5</sup>), this approach would be far too slow and time out. Due to its impracticality, we will not provide a code snippet.</p>
<p><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> Exponential, far too large to be practical.
<strong>Space Complexity:</strong> Exponential, to store all generated strings.</p>

<h3>Frequency Counting and Sorting Approach</h3>
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>The key to this problem is to understand the properties that are preserved or transformed by the given operations.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Operation 1 (Swap any two existing characters):</strong> This operation allows us to rearrange the characters of a string in any way. This means the order of characters doesn't matter. What matters is the count of each character. For example, "abc" and "bca" are equivalent under this operation because they both have one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operation 2 (Transform characters):</strong> This operation allows us to swap the roles of two characters. For example, we can turn all 'a's into 'b's and all 'b's into 'a's. This implies that the frequency counts themselves can be reassigned to different characters. For instance, a string with character counts {'a': 3, 'b': 5} can be transformed into one with {'a': 5, 'b': 3}.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Combining these insights, two strings are "close" if and only if they meet two conditions:
1.  <strong>They must have the same set of unique characters.</strong> Neither operation can introduce a new character that wasn't present before or eliminate a character entirely.
2.  <strong>They must have the same multiset of character frequencies.</strong> Operation 1 doesn't change frequencies, and Operation 2 only shuffles the frequencies among the existing characters. Therefore, the collection of frequency counts must be identical. For example, if one string has one character appearing 3 times and another 5 times, the other string must also have one character appearing 3 times and another 5 times.</p>
<p>The algorithm implements these checks as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, perform a basic check: if the lengths of <code>word1</code> and <code>word2</code> are different, they can never be close, so return <code>false</code>.</li>
<li>Create two frequency arrays, <code>freq1</code> and <code>freq2</code> of size 26, to store the counts of each character for <code>word1</code> and <code>word2</code>, respectively.</li>
<li>Populate these arrays by iterating through the input strings.</li>
<li>Check if both strings have the same set of characters. This is done by iterating through the frequency arrays. If a character has a count greater than zero in one string but zero in the other, they don't share the same character set, so return <code>false</code>.</li>
<li>Check if the multisets of frequencies are the same. This can be efficiently verified by sorting both frequency arrays. If the sorted arrays are identical, it confirms that the collection of character counts is the same for both strings.</li>
<li>If both checks pass, the strings are close, and we return <code>true</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach has a time complexity of O(N) where N is the length of the strings, as the sorting is performed on a constant-size array (26). The space complexity is O(1).</p>
<h4>C++ Code</h4>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;

class Solution {
public:
    bool closeStrings(std::string word1, std::string word2) {
        if (word1.length() != word2.length()) {
            return false;
        }

        std::vector&lt;int&gt; freq1(26, 0);
        std::vector&lt;int&gt; freq2(26, 0);

        for (char ch : word1) {
            freq1[ch - 'a']++;
        }

        for (char ch : word2) {
            freq2[ch - 'a']++;
        }

        // Condition 1: Check if both strings have the same set of characters.
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 26; i++) {
            bool hasChar1 = (freq1[i] &gt; 0);
            bool hasChar2 = (freq2[i] &gt; 0);
            if (hasChar1 != hasChar2) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        // Condition 2: Check if the multisets of frequencies are the same.
        std::sort(freq1.begin(), freq1.end());
        std::sort(freq2.begin(), freq2.end());

        if (freq1 == freq2) {
            return true;
        }

        return false;
    }

<h3>Pythonic Solution (Best Approach)</h3>
<p>The optimal approach can be implemented more concisely in Python using the <code>collections.Counter</code> class, which simplifies frequency counting. The logic remains the same: we check if the character sets are identical and if the multisets of their frequencies are identical.</p>
<ol>
<li>Check for equal length.</li>
<li>Use <code>collections.Counter</code> to get frequency maps for both strings.</li>
<li>The set of characters can be compared by checking if the keys of the two counters are equal.</li>
<li>The multiset of frequencies can be compared by checking if the sorted lists of the values of the two counters are equal.</li>
<li>Return <code>true</code> only if both conditions are met.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-python">from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def closeStrings(self, word1: str, word2: str) -&gt; bool:
        # Condition 0: Length must be the same
        if len(word1) != len(word2):
            return False

        # Get frequency counts of characters
        count1 = Counter(word1)
        count2 = Counter(word2)

        # Condition 1: The set of characters must be the same
        if count1.keys() != count2.keys():
            return False

        # Condition 2: The multiset of frequencies must be the same
        # We can check this by comparing the sorted lists of frequencies
        if sorted(count1.values()) != sorted(count2.values()):
            return False

        return True

<div class='ai-explanation'><h3>Explanation of Approaches</h3>
<p>The problem asks us to find two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a specific target. The key constraints are that the array is sorted and the solution must use constant extra space. Three main approaches can be considered:</p>
<h4>1. Two-Pointer Approach</h4>
<p>This is the most efficient approach that fully leverages the fact that the array is sorted and meets the constant space requirement.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Logic</strong>: We initialize two pointers: <code>left</code> at the beginning of the array (index 0) and <code>right</code> at the end of the array. We then calculate the sum of the values at these two pointers.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the <code>sum</code> equals the <code>target</code>, we have found our pair.</li>
<li>If the <code>sum</code> is less than the <code>target</code>, it means we need a larger sum. Since the array is sorted, we can increase the sum by moving the <code>left</code> pointer one position to the right.</li>
<li>If the <code>sum</code> is greater than the <code>target</code>, we need a smaller sum. We can achieve this by moving the <code>right</code> pointer one position to the left.
This process continues until the pointers meet or cross, guaranteeing we check all potential pairs efficiently. Since a solution is guaranteed to exist, we will find it before the loop terminates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Time Complexity</strong>: <strong>O(n)</strong>. The <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> pointers together traverse the array at most once.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Space Complexity</strong>: <strong>O(1)</strong>. We only use a few variables to store the pointers and the sum, regardless of the input array's size.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Hash Map (Dictionary) Approach</h4>
<p>This is a common solution for the general "Two Sum" problem where the array is not sorted. It does not meet the space complexity constraint for this specific problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Logic</strong>: We iterate through the array once. For each element <code>num</code>, we calculate the required complement (<code>target - num</code>). We then check if this complement exists in a hash map.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the complement is found in the map, we have our pair and can return their indices.</li>
<li>If not, we add the current element and its index to the hash map for future checks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Time Complexity</strong>: <strong>O(n)</strong>. Each lookup and insertion in the hash map takes average O(1) time, and we iterate through the array once.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Space Complexity</strong>: <strong>O(n)</strong>. In the worst case, we might store all <code>n</code> elements in the hash map. This violates the problem's O(1) space constraint.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Binary Search Approach</h4>
<p>This approach also uses the sorted property of the array and meets the space constraint, but it's less time-efficient than the two-pointer method.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Logic</strong>: We iterate through the array with an outer loop, fixing one number <code>numbers[i]</code>. For each number, we need to find its complement <code>target - numbers[i]</code> in the rest of the array (from index <code>i+1</code> to the end). Since the rest of the array is also sorted, we can use binary search to look for the complement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Time Complexity</strong>: <strong>O(n log n)</strong>. The outer loop runs <code>n</code> times, and for each iteration, binary search takes O(log n) time.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Space Complexity</strong>: <strong>O(1)</strong>. The binary search is performed in-place and doesn't require extra space proportional to the input size.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the analysis, the <strong>Two-Pointer approach is the best solution</strong> as it provides the optimal time complexity of O(n) while adhering to the O(1) space constraint.</p>
<h3>Best Solution (C++)</h3>
<p>```cpp</p>
<h1>include <vector></h1>
<p>class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> twoSum(std::vector<int>&amp; numbers, int target) {
        // Initialize two pointers, one at the start and one at the end.
        int left = 0;
        int right = numbers.size() - 1;</p>
<pre><code>    // Loop until the two pointers meet.
    while (left &lt; right) {
        int current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];

        if (current_sum == target) {
            // Found the solution. Return 1-based indices.
            return {left + 1, right + 1};
        } else if (current_sum &lt; target) {
            // The sum is too small, need a larger number.
            // Move the left pointer to the right.
            left++;
        } else { // current_sum &gt; target
            // The sum is too large, need a smaller number.
            // Move the right pointer to the left.
            right--;
        }
    }

    // Since a solution is guaranteed, this part is unreachable.
    // It's included to satisfy function return type.
    return {}; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>};
```</p>
<h3>Best Solution (Python)</h3>
<p>```python
from typing import List</p>
<p>class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -&gt; List[int]:
        # Initialize two pointers, one at the start and one at the end.
        left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1</p>
<pre><code>    # Loop until the two pointers meet.
    while left &lt; right:
        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]

        if current_sum == target:
            # Found the solution. Return 1-based indices.
            return [left + 1, right + 1]
        elif current_sum &lt; target:
            # The sum is too small, need a larger number.
            # Move the left pointer to the right.
            left += 1
        else:  # current_sum &gt; target
            # The sum is too large, need a smaller number.
            # Move the right pointer to the left.
            right -= 1

    # A solution is guaranteed by the problem constraints, so the loop
    # will always find a pair and return from within the loop.

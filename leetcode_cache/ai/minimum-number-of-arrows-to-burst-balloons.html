<h3>Brute Force Approach</h3>
<p>A brute-force solution would explore all possible ways to shoot arrows. We could define a recursive function that takes the set of remaining balloons. In each step, we would pick an unburst balloon and try placing an arrow at every possible integer position within its range. For each placement, we'd find all balloons burst by that arrow and recursively call the function for the remaining ones. We would keep track of the minimum arrows needed across all these choices. This approach is highly inefficient due to its exponential nature and the vast number of possibilities to check, making it unsuitable for the given constraints.</p>
<p>The time complexity would be exponential, far too slow for <code>N</code> up to 10<sup>5</sup>, and the space complexity would be O(N) for the recursion stack.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Greedy Approach (Sort by Start Points)</h3>
<p>This greedy strategy involves sorting the balloons by their start points and then iterating through them to merge overlapping intervals. An arrow is used for each group of overlapping balloons.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sort:</strong> Sort the <code>points</code> array based on the start points (<code>x_start</code>) of the balloons in ascending order.</li>
<li><strong>Initialize:</strong> Start with one arrow (<code>arrows = 1</code>) and define the current group's potential shooting range. The end of this range is initially the end point of the first balloon (<code>current_end = points[0][1]</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Iterate:</strong> Traverse the sorted balloons from the second one.</li>
<li><strong>Check for Overlap:</strong> For each balloon, compare its start point with <code>current_end</code>.<ul>
<li>If the balloon starts <em>after</em> <code>current_end</code> (<code>point[0] &gt; current_end</code>), it cannot be burst by the same arrow as the previous group. We need a new arrow. Increment <code>arrows</code> and update <code>current_end</code> to the end point of this new balloon.</li>
<li>If the balloon starts <em>at or before</em> <code>current_end</code>, it overlaps with the current group. To ensure a single arrow can burst this balloon along with the others in the group, we must shrink the shooting range. Update <code>current_end</code> to be the minimum of its current value and this balloon's end point (<code>current_end = min(current_end, point[1])</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Return:</strong> After checking all balloons, <code>arrows</code> holds the minimum number required.</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach has a time complexity of <strong>O(N log N)</strong> due to sorting and a space complexity of <strong>O(1)</strong> or <strong>O(log N)</strong> depending on the sort implementation.</p>

<h3>Greedy Approach (Sort by End Points)</h3>
<p>This is another, often more intuitive, greedy approach. The idea is that to burst a balloon, we must shoot an arrow. To be most efficient, we should place that arrow at the balloon's end point. This maximizes its reach and the potential to burst subsequent balloons.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sort:</strong> Sort the <code>points</code> array based on the end points (<code>x_end</code>) of the balloons in ascending order. This helps us process balloons that finish the earliest first.</li>
<li><strong>Initialize:</strong> We need at least one arrow for the first balloon. Initialize <code>arrows = 1</code>. Place this first arrow at the end of the first balloon (the one with the smallest <code>x_end</code> after sorting): <code>arrow_pos = points[0][1]</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Iterate:</strong> Traverse the sorted balloons from the second one.</li>
<li><strong>Check Coverage:</strong> For each balloon, check if its start point is beyond the position of our last arrow (<code>points[i][0] &gt; arrow_pos</code>).<ul>
<li>If it is, the last arrow cannot burst this balloon. We need a new arrow. Increment <code>arrows</code> and update <code>arrow_pos</code> to the end point of the <em>current</em> balloon (<code>arrow_pos = points[i][1]</code>).</li>
<li>If the balloon's start point is not beyond <code>arrow_pos</code>, it means our last arrow already bursts this balloon, so we can move on without needing a new arrow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Return:</strong> The final value of <code>arrows</code> is the minimum number required.</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach also has a time complexity of <strong>O(N log N)</strong> dominated by sorting and a space complexity of <strong>O(1)</strong> or <strong>O(log N)</strong>.</p>

        }

        // Custom sort using a lambda function to sort by end points

<h3>Pythonic Solution (Best Approach)</h3>
<p>The greedy approach of sorting by end points is very efficient and clean to implement in Python.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findMinArrowShots(self, points: List[List[int]]) -&gt; int:
        # If there are no balloons, no arrows are needed.
        if not points:
            return 0

        # Sort the balloons based on their end points.
        points.sort(key=lambda p: p[1])

        arrows = 1
        # The first arrow is shot at the end of the first balloon.
        arrow_pos = points[0][1]

        # Iterate through the rest of the balloons.
        for start, end in points:
            # If the current balloon starts after the last arrow,
            # it cannot be burst by the previous arrow.
            if start &gt; arrow_pos:
                # We need a new arrow.
                arrows += 1
                # Update the arrow position to the end of the current balloon.
                arrow_pos = end

        return arrows

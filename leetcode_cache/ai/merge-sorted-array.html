<div class='ai-explanation'><h3>Explanation of Approaches</h3>
<p>The problem asks us to merge two sorted arrays, <code>nums2</code> into <code>nums1</code>, in-place. <code>nums1</code> has enough space allocated at its end to hold all elements from <code>nums2</code>. Two main approaches are presented in the solutions.</p>
<h4>Approach 1: Copy and Sort</h4>
<p>This is a simple and intuitive approach.
1.  First, copy all the elements from <code>nums2</code> into the trailing zero-filled part of <code>nums1</code>.
2.  Then, use a built-in sorting algorithm to sort the entire <code>nums1</code> array.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> <strong>O((m+n) log(m+n))</strong>
    The copy operation takes O(n) time. The main cost is the sorting operation, which for an array of size <code>m+n</code>, is typically O((m+n) log(m+n)).</li>
<li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> <strong>O(1)</strong>
    The merge is done in-place. The space used by the sorting algorithm is typically logarithmic (for the recursion stack) or constant, and is often considered O(1) auxiliary space in this context.</li>
</ul>
<p>This method is easy to implement but doesn't take advantage of the fact that the initial arrays are already sorted, leading to a suboptimal time complexity.</p>
<h4>Approach 2: Two Pointers (from the end)</h4>
<p>This is the optimal approach, as it leverages the sorted nature of the arrays and the available space at the end of <code>nums1</code>. A naive merge from the beginning would require shifting elements, which is inefficient. By filling <code>nums1</code> from the end, we avoid overwriting elements that we still need to read.</p>
<ol>
<li>Initialize three pointers:<ul>
<li><code>i</code> points to the last valid element of <code>nums1</code> (<code>m-1</code>).</li>
<li><code>j</code> points to the last element of <code>nums2</code> (<code>n-1</code>).</li>
<li><code>k</code> points to the last position of the <code>nums1</code> array (<code>m+n-1</code>), which is where the largest element of the merged array will go.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Iterate backwards from the end of both arrays. In each step, compare <code>nums1[i]</code> and <code>nums2[j]</code>.</li>
<li>Place the larger of the two elements at the <code>k</code>-th position in <code>nums1</code>.</li>
<li>Decrement the pointer of the array from which the element was taken (<code>i</code> or <code>j</code>) and also decrement the write pointer <code>k</code>.</li>
<li>
<p>This process continues until all elements from <code>nums2</code> have been considered (<code>j</code> becomes less than 0). If there are still elements left in <code>nums1</code> (<code>i &gt;= 0</code>), they are already in their correct sorted positions at the beginning of the array, so no further action is needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> <strong>O(m + n)</strong>
    We perform a single pass through the elements of both arrays.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> <strong>O(1)</strong>
    The operation is performed in-place using only three pointers, requiring no extra storage.</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach is the best solution due to its linear time complexity and constant space usage.</p>

<h3>For each approach, give a brief step by step explanation of the approach (with time &amp; space complexity in the last sentence) and code snippet in C++</h3>
<h4>1. Brute Force Approach</h4>
<p>The most straightforward way to find the minimum element is to iterate through the entire array and keep track of the smallest value encountered.</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong>
1.  Initialize a variable, <code>min_element</code>, with the value of the first element in the array.
2.  Iterate through the array from the second element to the end.
3.  In each iteration, compare the current element with <code>min_element</code>.
4.  If the current element is smaller, update <code>min_element</code> to the value of the current element.
5.  After the loop completes, <code>min_element</code> will hold the minimum value in the array.</p>
<p>This approach is simple to implement but does not meet the <code>O(log n)</code> time complexity requirement of the problem. The time complexity is <code>O(n)</code> as it requires scanning the entire array, and the space complexity is <code>O(1)</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;

class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(std::vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; nums) {
        int min_element = nums[0];
        for (size_t i = 1; i &lt; nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (nums[i] &lt; min_element) {
                min_element = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return min_element;
    }
};

<h4>2. Binary Search Approach</h4>
<p>Since the array is a rotated version of a sorted array, we can use a modified binary search to find the minimum element in logarithmic time. The key idea is to determine which half of the array contains the pivot point (the minimum element).</p>
<p>A rotated sorted array has a unique property: it consists of two sorted subarrays. The minimum element is the first element of the second subarray. We can use binary search to efficiently locate this element.</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong>
1.  Initialize two pointers, <code>low</code> to the start of the array (index 0) and <code>high</code> to the end (index <code>n-1</code>).
2.  If the array is not rotated at all (i.e., <code>nums[low] &lt;= nums[high]</code>), the minimum element is at the beginning, so we can return <code>nums[low]</code>.
3.  Enter a loop that continues as long as <code>low</code> is less than <code>high</code>.
4.  Calculate the middle index <code>mid</code>.
5.  Compare the middle element <code>nums[mid]</code> with the element at the <code>high</code> index, <code>nums[high]</code>:
    *   If <code>nums[mid] &gt; nums[high]</code>, it means the pivot (and thus the minimum element) must lie in the right half of the array (from <code>mid + 1</code> to <code>high</code>). So, we discard the left half by setting <code>low = mid + 1</code>.
    *   If <code>nums[mid] &lt;= nums[high]</code>, it means the subarray from <code>mid</code> to <code>high</code> is sorted. Therefore, the minimum element could be <code>nums[mid]</code> or an element in the left half. We discard the right half by setting <code>high = mid</code>.
6.  The loop terminates when <code>low</code> and <code>high</code> converge to the same index, which will be the index of the minimum element.
7.  Return the element at the <code>low</code> index.</p>
<p>This algorithm effectively halves the search space in each iteration, leading to a time complexity of <code>O(log n)</code> and a space complexity of <code>O(1)</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;vector&gt;

class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(std::vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; nums) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = nums.size() - 1;

        // The loop continues until the search space is narrowed down to one element.
        while (low &lt; high) {
            // Optimization: If the current search space is already sorted,
            // the minimum element is at the 'low' index.
            if (nums[low] &lt; nums[high]) {
                return nums[low];
            }

            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            // If mid element is greater than the high element,
            // the minimum must be in the right part.
            if (nums[mid] &gt; nums[high]) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                // Otherwise, the minimum is in the left part (including mid),
                // as mid could be the minimum itself.
                high = mid;
            }
        }
        // When low == high, we have found the minimum element.
        return nums[low];
    }
};

<h3>Lastly provide pythonic solution for best approach only</h3>
<pre><code class="language-python">from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -&gt; int:
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        Finds the minimum element in a rotated sorted array using binary search.
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        low, high = 0, len(nums) - 1

        while low &lt; high:
            # If the current window is sorted, the first element is the minimum
            if nums[low] &lt; nums[high]:
                return nums[low]

            mid = low + (high - low) // 2

            # The inflection point is in the right half
            if nums[mid] &gt; nums[high]:
                low = mid + 1
            # The inflection point is in the left half (or at mid)
            else:
                high = mid

        # The loop terminates when low == high, which points to the minimum element
        return nums[low]

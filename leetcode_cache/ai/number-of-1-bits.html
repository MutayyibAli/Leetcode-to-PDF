<h3>Brute Force Approach: Checking Each Bit</h3>
<p>This method iterates through each bit of the integer to check if it is a '1'. It uses a bitwise AND operation to check the least significant bit (LSB) and then right-shifts the number to check the next bit. The loop continues until all bits have been checked (i.e., the number becomes zero).</p>
<ol>
<li>Initialize a counter variable, <code>count</code>, to zero.</li>
<li>Start a loop that continues as long as <code>n</code> is greater than zero.</li>
<li>Inside the loop, use the expression <code>n &amp; 1</code> to check if the LSB of <code>n</code> is a '1'.</li>
<li>Add the result (which is either 0 or 1) to <code>count</code>.</li>
<li>Right-shift <code>n</code> by one position (<code>n &gt;&gt;= 1</code>) to move the next bit to the LSB position for the next iteration.</li>
<li>Once the loop finishes, <code>count</code> will hold the total number of set bits. Return <code>count</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The time complexity is O(k) where k is the number of bits in the integer (e.g., 32), and the space complexity is O(1).</p>

public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            // Check if the least significant bit is 1
            if (n &amp; 1) {
                count++;
            }
            // Right shift to check the next bit
            n = n &gt;&gt; 1;
        }
        return count;
    }

<h3>Optimized Approach: Brian Kernighan's Algorithm</h3>
<p>This is a clever bit manipulation trick that is more efficient than checking every bit. The core idea is that the operation <code>n &amp; (n - 1)</code> unsets the rightmost set bit ('1') of a number. By repeatedly applying this operation and counting the iterations, we can find the number of set bits. The loop runs exactly as many times as there are '1's in the number.</p>
<ol>
<li>Initialize a counter variable, <code>count</code>, to zero.</li>
<li>Start a loop that continues as long as <code>n</code> is not zero.</li>
<li>In each iteration, update <code>n</code> by performing <code>n = n &amp; (n - 1)</code>. This operation clears the rightmost '1'.</li>
<li>Increment the <code>count</code>.</li>
<li>The loop terminates when <code>n</code> becomes 0, meaning all set bits have been cleared.</li>
<li>Return the final <code>count</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The time complexity is O(m) where m is the number of set bits, which is more efficient than the brute-force approach for numbers with few set bits. The space complexity is O(1).</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;cstdint&gt;

class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            // This operation unsets the rightmost set bit
            n = n &amp; (n - 1);
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};

<h3>Pythonic Solution (Best Approach)</h3>
<p>The most efficient and elegant algorithmic approach is Brian Kernighan's algorithm. A more direct Pythonic way is to convert the number to a binary string and count the '1's, but the bit manipulation method is a better demonstration of the underlying computer science principle.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -&gt; int:
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        This solution uses the Brian Kernighan's algorithm.
        The expression n &amp; (n - 1) clears the least significant set bit.
        The loop runs as many times as there are set bits.
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        count = 0
        while n:
            n &amp;= (n - 1)
            count += 1
        return count

# An even more &quot;Pythonic&quot; but potentially less performant way for very large numbers
# due to string conversion overhead, though highly readable:
#
# class Solution:
#     def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -&gt; int:
#         return bin(n).count('1')

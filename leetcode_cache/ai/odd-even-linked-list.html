<h3>Brute Force Approach (Using Extra Space)</h3>
<p>This approach involves separating the nodes into two distinct listsâ€”one for odd-indexed nodes and one for even-indexed nodes. We then link the end of the odd list to the beginning of the even list.</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong>
1.  Handle edge cases where the list has 0, 1, or 2 nodes; in these cases, the list is already sorted, so we can return the head.
2.  Create two dummy nodes, <code>oddHead</code> and <code>evenHead</code>, to act as the starting points for our new odd and even lists. Also, create tail pointers <code>oddTail</code> and <code>evenTail</code> to easily append nodes.
3.  Initialize a counter or a boolean flag to keep track of whether the current node's index is odd or even.
4.  Iterate through the original linked list. For each node:
    *   If its index is odd, append it to the list pointed to by <code>oddTail</code>.
    *   If its index is even, append it to the list pointed to by <code>evenTail</code>.
5.  After the loop, terminate the even list by setting <code>evenTail.next = nullptr</code>.
6.  Connect the tail of the odd list to the head of the even list (<code>oddTail.next = evenHead.next</code>).
7.  Return the start of the newly formed odd list, which is <code>oddHead.next</code>.</p>
<p>This approach is straightforward but requires creating new list structures, which uses extra space proportional to the number of nodes. This does not meet the O(1) space complexity requirement of the problem.</p>
<p>This approach has a time complexity of O(N) because we traverse the list once, and a space complexity of O(N) because we create two new lists.</p>

<h3>Optimal Approach (In-place Manipulation)</h3>
<p>The most efficient approach is to reorder the list in-place, without using any extra data structures. We can achieve this by maintaining two pointers: one for the tail of the odd-indexed nodes and one for the tail of the even-indexed nodes. We then iterate through the list, rewiring the <code>next</code> pointers to separate the nodes.</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong>
1.  Handle edge cases: If the list is empty or has only one or two nodes, no reordering is needed, so return the <code>head</code>.
2.  Initialize two pointers: <code>odd</code> pointing to the <code>head</code> (first node, index 1) and <code>even</code> pointing to <code>head-&gt;next</code> (second node, index 2).
3.  Create a separate pointer <code>even_start</code> to store the head of the even list (<code>head-&gt;next</code>), as we will need to connect it to the end of the odd list later.
4.  Iterate through the list as long as <code>even</code> and <code>even-&gt;next</code> are valid nodes. In each iteration:
    *   Connect the current <code>odd</code> node to the next odd node: <code>odd-&gt;next = even-&gt;next</code>.
    *   Move the <code>odd</code> pointer forward to this new node: <code>odd = odd-&gt;next</code>.
    *   Connect the current <code>even</code> node to the next even node: <code>even-&gt;next = odd-&gt;next</code>.
    *   Move the <code>even</code> pointer forward: <code>even = even-&gt;next</code>.
5.  After the loop terminates, the <code>odd</code> pointer will be at the last node of the odd-indexed list. Connect this last odd node to the head of the even-indexed list: <code>odd-&gt;next = even_start</code>.
6.  Return the original <code>head</code>, which is still the head of the reordered list.</p>
<p>This approach traverses the linked list a single time while only using a few extra pointers. This satisfies the problem constraints of O(N) time and O(1) space complexity.</p>

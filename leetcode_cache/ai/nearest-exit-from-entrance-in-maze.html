<h3>1. Depth-First Search (DFS) with Memoization</h3>
<p>This approach attempts to solve the problem by recursively exploring the maze from the entrance. It uses memoization (or dynamic programming) to store the shortest distance from a given cell to an exit to avoid re-computation. However, this approach is fundamentally flawed for finding the shortest path in a grid with cycles. DFS explores one path to its depth before backtracking. The first time it calculates the shortest path from a cell <code>(r, c)</code>, it might do so via a suboptimal route. This incorrect result gets stored and reused, potentially leading to a wrong overall answer. BFS is the standard algorithm for shortest paths in unweighted graphs/grids because it explores layer by layer.</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Define a recursive function, <code>dfs(row, col)</code>, that returns the minimum steps from <code>(row, col)</code> to any exit.</li>
<li>Use a memoization table (e.g., a 2D array) to store the results of <code>dfs(row, col)</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Base Cases:</strong><ul>
<li>If the current cell is out of bounds or a wall (<code>'+'</code>), it's an invalid path, so return a very large value (infinity).</li>
<li>If the current cell is an exit (a border cell that is not the entrance), the path ends here, so return 0.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Recursive Step:</strong><ul>
<li>To prevent getting stuck in cycles during the exploration of a single path, mark the current cell as visited (e.g., temporarily change it to a wall <code>'+'</code>).</li>
<li>Recursively call <code>dfs</code> for all four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).</li>
<li>Find the minimum steps among the results from the recursive calls.</li>
<li>The result for the current cell is <code>1 + minimum_steps_from_neighbors</code>.</li>
<li>Backtrack: Revert the cell's state back to an empty cell (<code>'.'</code>) so it can be used by other paths.</li>
<li>Store this result in the memoization table and return it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Call <code>dfs</code> with the <code>entrance</code> coordinates. If the returned value is infinity, no path exists; otherwise, it's the shortest path length.</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach has a time and space complexity of O(m * n) due to memoization and recursion depth.</p>

<h3>2. Breadth-First Search (BFS)</h3>
<p>This is the correct and optimal approach for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like a maze. BFS explores the maze level by level, starting from the entrance. This guarantees that the first time an exit is reached, it will be via the shortest possible path.</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Initialize a queue and add the starting <code>entrance</code> cell along with its initial distance (0 steps).</li>
<li>Mark the <code>entrance</code> cell as visited to prevent cycles. A common technique is to change its character in the <code>maze</code> to <code>'+'</code>.</li>
<li>Define the four possible directions of movement (up, down, left, right).</li>
<li>Begin a loop that continues as long as the queue is not empty.</li>
<li>In each iteration, dequeue a cell <code>{row, col, distance}</code>.</li>
<li>For each of the four possible directions:<ul>
<li>Calculate the coordinates of the neighboring cell.</li>
<li>Check if the neighbor is within the maze boundaries and is an empty cell (<code>.</code>).</li>
<li>If the neighbor is valid and unvisited:<ul>
<li>Mark it as visited (change its value to <code>'+'</code>).</li>
<li>Check if this neighbor is an exit (i.e., it's on the border of the maze).</li>
<li>If it is an exit, we have found the shortest path. Return <code>distance + 1</code>.</li>
<li>If it's not an exit, enqueue the neighbor with an updated distance: <code>{new_row, new_col, distance + 1}</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the queue becomes empty and no exit has been found, it means no path to an exit exists. Return -1.</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach has a time complexity of O(m * n) as each cell is visited at most once, and a space complexity of O(m * n) for the queue in the worst-case scenario.</p>

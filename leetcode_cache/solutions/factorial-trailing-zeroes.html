<div class='cpp-solution'><h4>4-lines 4ms C++ Solution with Explanations [Votes: 100]</h4><p>Well, to compute the number of trailing zeros, we need to first think clear about what will generate a trailing <code>0</code>? Obviously, a number multiplied by <code>10</code> will have a trailing <code>0</code> added to it. So we only need to find out how many <code>10</code>'s will appear in the expression of the factorial. Since <code>10 = 2 * 5</code> and there are a bunch more <code>2</code>'s (each even number will contribute at least one <code>2</code>), we only need to count the number of <code>5</code>'s.</p>
<p>Now let's see what numbers will contribute a <code>5</code>. Well, simply the multiples of <code>5</code>, like <code>5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 35, ...</code>. So is the result simply <code>n / 5</code>? Well, not that easy. Notice that some numbers may contribute more than one <code>5</code>, like <code>25 = 5 * 5</code>. Well, what numbers will contribute more than one <code>5</code>? Ok, you may notice that only multiples of the power of <code>5</code> will contribute more than one <code>5</code>. For example, multiples of <code>25</code> will contribute at least two <code>5</code>'s.</p>
<p>Well, how to count them all? If you try some examples, you may finally get the result, which is <code>n / 5 + n / 25 + n / 125 + ...</code>. The idea behind this expression is: all the multiples of <code>5</code> will contribute one <code>5</code>, the multiples of <code>25</code> will contribute one more <code>5</code> and the multiples of <code>125</code> will contribute another one more <code>5</code>... and so on. Now, we can write down the following code, which is pretty short.</p>
<pre><code>class Solution {
public:
    int trailingZeroes(int n) { 
        int count = 0;
        for (long long i = 5; n / i; i *= 5)
            count += n / i;
        return count;
    }
};

<li>meet the number that can be dived by 5, the Trailing will have 1 more zero.</li>
</ol>
<p>2 .meet the number that can be dived by 5*5, the Trailing will have 2 more zero.
..</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>so we just find how many number can be dived by 5, can be dived by 5*5 ...  and sum up.</p>
<pre><code>    def trailingZeroes(self, n):
        r = 0
        while n &gt; 0:
            n /= 5
            r += n
        return r

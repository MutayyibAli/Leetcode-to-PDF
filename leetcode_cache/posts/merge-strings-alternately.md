# Solution:
#### Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
>The problem asks to merge two strings alternately. Therefore, we can traverse both strings at the same time and pick each character alternately from both strings.

#### Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
>1. Initialize an empty string to store the merged result.
>2. Traverse both input strings together, picking each character alternately from both strings and appending it to the merged result string.
>3. Continue the traversal until the end of the longer string is reached.
>4. Return the merged result string.


#### Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
>Since we traverse both strings once and pick each character alternately, the time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the longer string.

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
>We use a StringBuilder to store the merged string, so the space complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the longer string.

# Solution:

#### Intuition:

The intuition is to group words that are anagrams of each other together. Anagrams are words that have the `same` characters but in a `different` order.

#### Explanation:

Let's go through the code step by step using the example input `["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]` to understand how it works.

1. **Initializing Variables**
    - We start by initializing an empty unordered map called `mp` (short for map), which will store the groups of anagrams.

2. **Grouping Anagrams**
We iterate through each word in the input vector `strs`. Let's take the first word, "eat", as an example.

    - **Sorting the Word**
We create a string variable called `word` and assign it the value of the current word ("eat" in this case). 

        Next, we sort the characters in `word` using the `sort()` function. After sorting, `word` becomes "aet". 

    - **Grouping the Anagram**
We insert `word` as the key into the `mp` unordered map using `mp[word]`, and we push the original word ("eat") into the vector associated with that key using `mp[word].push_back(x)`, where `x` is the current word.

        Since "aet" is a unique sorted representation of all the anagrams, it serves as the key in the `mp` map, and the associated vector holds all the anagrams. 

For the given example, the `mp` map would look like this after processing all the words:
```
{
  "aet": ["eat", "tea", "ate"],
  "ant": ["tan", "nat"],
  "abt": ["bat"]
}
```

3. **Creating the Result**
We initialize an empty vector called `ans` (short for answer) to store the final result.

    - We iterate through each key-value pair in the `mp` map using a range-based for loop. For each pair, we push the vector of anagrams (`x.second`) into the `ans` vector.

For the given example, the `ans` vector would look like this:
```
[
  ["eat", "tea", "ate"],
  ["tan", "nat"],
  ["bat"]
]
```

4. **Returning the Result**
We return the `ans` vector, which contains the groups of anagrams.

#### Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> groupAnagrams(vector<string>& strs) {
        unordered_map<string, vector<string>> mp;
        
        for(auto x: strs){
            string word = x;
            sort(word.begin(), word.end());
            mp[word].push_back(x);
        }
        
        vector<vector<string>> ans;
        for(auto x: mp){
            ans.push_back(x.second);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
```Java
class Solution {
    public List<List<String>> groupAnagrams(String[] strs) {
        Map<String, List<String>> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (String word : strs) {
            char[] chars = word.toCharArray();
            Arrays.sort(chars);
            String sortedWord = new String(chars);
            
            if (!map.containsKey(sortedWord)) {
                map.put(sortedWord, new ArrayList<>());
            }
            
            map.get(sortedWord).add(word);
        }
        
        return new ArrayList<>(map.values());
    }
}
```
```Python3
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs):
        anagram_map = defaultdict(list)
        
        for word in strs:
            sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))
            anagram_map[sorted_word].append(word)
        
        return list(anagram_map.values())
```

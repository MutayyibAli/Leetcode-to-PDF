Cpp Solution:
Hi , everybody . This question is quite easy. I am quite confident that most of you would have reached atleast 1 of the following approaches to solve this question. But , incase you missed any of them , do give this a read.
### EXPLANATION :
**The question simply asks us to find an element in the given array whose frequency is 1.All the other elements have a frequency=2. 
We have to do so in :**
* **Linear Time**
* **Using Constant Space**



##### METHOD 1 : USING MAPS (NOT USING CONSTANT SPACE ) 
The question states that we have to find an element in the array with frequency=1. 
So , the first idea that pops in the mind is to store the frequency of each element in a map (or a frequency array) and then traverse that map/array and return the element with frequency=1. 

1. Map the given array's elements to their frequency. ( KEY : ELEMENT , VALUE : FREQUENCY )
2. Traverse that map and return the key whose value =1. 

##### CODE : 
``` 
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) { 
       unordered_map<int,int> a;
	   for(auto x: nums)
		   a[x]++;
	   for(auto z:a)
		   if(z.second==1)
			   return z.first;
	   return -1;
    }
};
``` 

**TC: O(N)**
**SC: O(N)**


Now , if we see the above method uses variable extra space, which is why it can't be our answer. 
(Although it is an approach to solve this problem). 
Then how do we solve this ?? 
Imagine you have blocks with the array elements inscribed on them. Now , if I sort the array for you and now ask you to find the element , CAN YOU DO SO ?? 

Yes , upon sorting , every element will have a similar element adjacent to it , if it has the frequency of 2.

##### METHOD 2 : USING SORTING (USING CONSTANT SPACE ) 
As explained above , we do the following :
1. Sort the array. 
2. Traverse the array and check if one of the adjacent elements is equal to the current element or not. 
3. If yes , move ahead. Else return the current element. 

##### CODE : 
``` 
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) { 
       sort(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        for(int i=1;i<nums.size();i+=2)
        {
            if(nums[i]!=nums[i-1])
                return nums[i-1];
        }
        return nums[nums.size()-1];
    }
};
``` 

**TC: O(NlogN)**
**SC: O(1)**

The above approach can be used to solve the problem . But what if we can improve the time complexity ??
What if we don't have to sort the array ?? 
The following method deals with that approach. 
##### METHOD 3 : USING BITWISE XOR OPERATOR (USING CONSTANT SPACE ) 
To use this approach you first need to understand about Bitwise XOR operator. 
Most of us who have a background in physics ( highschool level ) , are aware of the LOGIC GATES. 
One of such gates is the XOR Gate : 
According to this gate , the output is true , only if both the inputs are of opposite kind . 
That is , 
					 **A             B                   Y**
					 **0             0                    0**
					 **0             1                    1**
					 **1             0                    1**
					 **1             1                    0**
					 
We apply the extended version of this gate in our bitwise XOR operator. 
If we do "a^b" , it means that we are applying the XOR gate on the 2 numbers in a bitwise fashion ( on each of the corresponding bits of the numbers). 
Similarly , if we observe , 
1.  ***A^A=0***
2.  ***A^B^A=B***
3.  ***(A^A^B) = (B^A^A) = (A^B^A) = B***  This shows that position doesn't matter. 
4.  Similarly , if we see , ***a^a^a......... (even times)=0 and a^a^a........(odd times)=a***

Google It for more details. 

We apply the above observations : 
1. Traverse the array and take the Bitwise XOR of each element. 
2. Return the value. 

**Why does this work ??**
Because , the elements with frequency=2 will result in 0. And then the only element with frequency=1 will generate the answer. 
					 
##### CODE : 
``` 
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) { 
       int ans=0;
	   for(auto x:nums)
	   ans^=x;
	   return ans;
    }
};
``` 

**TC: O(N)**
**SC: O(1)**


### PS : METHOD 4: SUM OF ELEMENTS 
All the unique elements , in the array have a frequency of 2 , except one element. 

1. Store all the unique elements in set. 
2. Add the elements of the set and multiply by 2 (SUM_1). 
3. Add all the elements of the array(ARRAY_SUM). 
4. Return (SUM_1 - ARRAY_SUM) . 

**Why does this work ??**
ARRAY_SUM = 2*(a1+a2+a3...+ak) + a(k+1)
SUM_1 = 2*(a1+a2+a3+....+ak+ a(k+1)) 

*a(x) represents the xth unique element in the array. 
a(k+1) represents the element with frequency=1.*

Python Solution:

### Edge Cases:
1. No element appears twice; it is a constraint so not possible
2. Single length array; return the only element already present in the array
3. len(nums) > 1; find the single element that does not appear twice

### Approaches:
1. **Brute Force**
Intuition:
Iterate through every element in the nums and check if any of the element does not appear twice, in that case return the element.
*Time: O(n^2)
Space: O(1)*

2. **Use Sorting**
Intuition:
If the elements of the nums array are sorted/when we sort it, we can compare the neighbours to find the single element. It is already mentioned that all other elements appear twice except one.
*Time: O(nlogn) for sorting then O(n) to check neighbouring elements
Space: O(1)*

3. **Use Hashing/Set**
Intuition:
i) As we iterate through the nums array we store the elements encountered and check if we find them again while iteration continues. While checking if we find them again, we maintain a single_element object/variable which stores that single element, eventually returning the single_element.
ii) The other way is to maintain a num_frequency hashmap/dictionary and iterate over it to find which has exactly 1 frequency and return that key/num.
*Time: O(n) for iterating over the nums array
Space: O(n) for hashing*

4. **Use Xor/Bit Manipulation**
Intuition:
Xor of any two num gives the difference of bit as 1 and same bit as 0.
Thus, using this we get 1 ^ 1 == 0 because the same numbers have same bits.
So, we will always get the single element because all the same ones will evaluate to 0 and 0^single_number = single_number.
*Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)*

``` 
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        xor = 0
        for num in nums:
            xor ^= num
        
        return xor

``` 

In Golang:

``` 
func singleNumber(nums int) int {
    result := 0
    for _, num := range nums{
        result ^= num
    }

    return result
}
```

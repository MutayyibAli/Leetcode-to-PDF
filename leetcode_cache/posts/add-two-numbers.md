# Solution:
#### Intuition:
The Intuition is to iterate through two linked lists representing non-negative integers in reverse order, starting from the least significant digit. It performs digit-wise addition along with a carry value and constructs a new linked list to represent the sum. The process continues until both input lists and the carry value are exhausted. The resulting linked list represents the sum of the input numbers in the correct order.

#### Explanation: 
1. Create a placeholder node called `dummyHead` with a value of 0. This node will hold the resulting linked list.
2. Initialize a pointer called `tail` and set it to `dummyHead`. This pointer will keep track of the last node in the result list.
3. Initialize a variable called `carry` to 0. This variable will store the carry value during addition.
4. Start a loop that continues until there are no more digits in both input lists (`l1` and `l2`) and there is no remaining carry value.
5. Inside the loop:
   - Check if there is a digit in the current node of `l1`. If it exists, assign its value to a variable called `digit1`. Otherwise, set `digit1` to 0.
   - Check if there is a digit in the current node of `l2`. If it exists, assign its value to a variable called `digit2`. Otherwise, set `digit2` to 0.
   - Add the current digits from `l1` and `l2`, along with the carry value from the previous iteration, and store the sum in a variable called `sum`.
   - Calculate the unit digit of `sum` by taking the modulus (`%`) of `sum` by 10. This digit will be placed in a new node for the result.
   - Update the `carry` variable by dividing `sum` by 10 and taking the integer division (`/`) part. This gives us the carry value for the next iteration.
   - Create a new node with the calculated digit as its value.
   - Attach the new node to the `tail` node of the result list.
   - Move the `tail` pointer to the newly added node.
   - Move to the next nodes in both `l1` and `l2`, if they exist. If either list is exhausted, set the corresponding pointer to `nullptr`.
6. After the loop, obtain the actual result list by skipping the `dummyHead` node.
7. Delete the `dummyHead` node.
8. Return the resulting list.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* addTwoNumbers(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) {
        ListNode* dummyHead = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode* tail = dummyHead;
        int carry = 0;

        while (l1 != nullptr || l2 != nullptr || carry != 0) {
            int digit1 = (l1 != nullptr) ? l1->val : 0;
            int digit2 = (l2 != nullptr) ? l2->val : 0;

            int sum = digit1 + digit2 + carry;
            int digit = sum % 10;
            carry = sum / 10;

            ListNode* newNode = new ListNode(digit);
            tail->next = newNode;
            tail = tail->next;

            l1 = (l1 != nullptr) ? l1->next : nullptr;
            l2 = (l2 != nullptr) ? l2->next : nullptr;
        }

        ListNode* result = dummyHead->next;
        delete dummyHead;
        return result;
    }

            int digit2 = (l2 != null) ? l2.val : 0;

            int sum = digit1 + digit2 + carry;
            int digit = sum % 10;
            carry = sum / 10;

            sum = digit1 + digit2 + carry
            digit = sum % 10
            carry = sum // 10

Cpp Solution:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int count = 0;
        
        while (n) {
            n &= (n - 1);
            count++;
        }
        
        return count;
    }

n & (n - 1) drops the lowest set bit. It's a neat little bit trick.

Let's use n = 00101100 as an example. This binary representation has three 1s.

If n = 00101100, then n - 1 = 00101011, so n & (n - 1) = 00101100 & 00101011 = 00101000. Count = 1.

If n = 00101000, then n - 1 = 00100111, so n & (n - 1) = 00101000 & 00100111 = 00100000. Count = 2.

If n = 00100000, then n - 1 = 00011111, so n & (n - 1) = 00100000 & 00011111 = 00000000. Count = 3.

n is now zero, so the while loop ends, and the final count (the numbers of set bits) is returned.


Python Solution:
``` 
    def using_inbuilt_counter(self, n):
        counter = collections.Counter(bin(n)[2:])
        return counter.get("1", 0)
    
    def using_bit_manipulation(self, n):
        count = 0
        while n:
            if n & 1: count += 1
            n = n >> 1
        return count
```

#### Intuition
The intuition behind the solution is to keep track of the minimum cost to buy a stock at each day and the maximum profit that can be achieved by selling the stock at each day.

#### Approach:
1. Initialize two variables: `buy` and `sell`. Set `buy` to negative infinity and `sell` to zero. These variables will keep track of the maximum profit at each day.
2. Iterate through the prices of the stocks starting from the first day.
3. Update the `buy` variable by taking the maximum of its current value and the previous `sell` value minus the stock price. This represents the maximum profit after buying the stock.
   `buy = max(buy, sell - price)`

4. Update the `sell` variable by taking the maximum of its current value and the previous `buy` value plus the stock price minus the transaction fee. This represents the maximum profit after selling the stock.
   `sell = max(sell, buy + price - fee)`

5. After iterating through all the prices, the maximum profit will be stored in the `sell` variable.
6. Return the value of `sell` as the maximum profit.

#### Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(n)$$

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$$O(1)$$

#### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices, int fee) {
        int buy = INT_MIN;
        int sell = 0;

        for (int price : prices) {
            buy = max(buy, sell - price);
            sell = max(sell, buy + price - fee);
        }

        return sell;
    }
};
```
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices, int fee) {
        int buy = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int sell = 0;

        for (int price : prices) {
            buy = Math.max(buy, sell - price);
            sell = Math.max(sell, buy + price - fee);
        }

        return sell;
    }
}
```
```Python3
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:
        buy = float('-inf')
        sell = 0

        for price in prices:
            buy = max(buy, sell - price)
            sell = max(sell, buy + price - fee)

        return sell
```

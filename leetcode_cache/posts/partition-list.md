# Solution:
#### Problem Understanding

In the "Partition a Linked List Around a Value" problem, we are provided with the head of a linked list and a value `x`. The task is to rearrange the linked list such that all nodes with values less than `x` come before nodes with values greater than or equal to `x`. A key point is that the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions must be preserved.

Consider the linked list `head = [1,4,3,2,5,2]` and `x = 3`. The expected output after partitioning is `[1,2,2,4,3,5]`.

#### Approach: Two Pointer Technique with Dummy Nodes

The idea is to use two pointers (or references) to create two separate linked lists: 
1. One for nodes with values less than `x`
2. Another for nodes with values greater than or equal to `x`

At the end, we can combine the two linked lists to get the desired result.

##### Key Data Structures:
- **Linked List**: We work directly with the given linked list nodes.
- **Dummy Nodes**: Two dummy nodes are used to create the starting point for the two partitions.

##### Step-by-step Breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create two dummy nodes: `before` and `after`.
   - Initialize two pointers `before_curr` and `after_curr` at the dummy nodes.
   
2. **Traversal & Partition**:
   - Traverse the linked list with the given `head`.
   - For each node, if its value is less than `x`, attach it to the `before` list. Otherwise, attach it to the `after` list.
   
3. **Merging**:
   - After traversing the entire list, append the `after` list to the `before` list to form the partitioned linked list.

4. **Result**:
   - Return the next node of the `before` dummy node as the new head of the partitioned list.

#### Example - Visualization:
Based on the provided example with the linked list `head = [1,4,3,2,5,2]` and `x = 3`, here's the step-by-step evolution of the `before`, `after`, and `head` lists:



1. After processing node with value `1`:
    - `head`: [1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 2]
    - `before`: [0, 1]
    - `after`: [0]

2. After processing node with value `4`:
    - `head`: [4, 3, 2, 5, 2]
    - `before`: [0, 1]
    - `after`: [0, 4]

3. After processing node with value `3`:
    - `head`: [3, 2, 5, 2]
    - `before`: [0, 1]
    - `after`: [0, 4, 3]

4. After processing node with value `2`:
    - `head`: [2, 5, 2]
    - `before`: [0, 1, 2]
    - `after`: [0, 4, 3]

5. After processing node with value `5`:
    - `head`: [5, 2]
    - `before`: [0, 1, 2]
    - `after`: [0, 4, 3, 5]

6. After processing node with value `2`:
    - `head`: [2]
    - `before`: [0, 1, 2, 2]
    - `after`: [0, 4, 3, 5]

Finally, after merging the `before` and `after` lists, the result is: `[1,2,2,4,3,5]`

#### Complexity:

**Time Complexity:** $$O(n)$$
- We traverse the linked list once, making the time complexity linear in the size of the list.

**Space Complexity:** $$O(1)$$
- We use constant extra space since we are only creating two dummy nodes and reusing the existing nodes in the linked list.

#### Performance:

Given the constraints, this solution is optimal and will efficiently handle linked lists of size up to 200 nodes.

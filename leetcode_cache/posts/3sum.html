Cpp Solution:
the key idea is the same as the `TwoSum` problem. When we fix the `1st` number, the `2nd` and `3rd` number can be found following the same reasoning as `TwoSum`. 

The only difference is that, the `TwoSum` problem of LEETCODE has a unique solution. However, in `ThreeSum`, we have multiple duplicate solutions that can be found. Most of the OLE errors happened here because you could've ended up with a solution with so many duplicates.

The naive solution for the duplicates will be using the STL methods like below :


    std::sort(res.begin(), res.end());
    res.erase(unique(res.begin(), res.end()), res.end());


But according to my submissions, this way will cause you double your time consuming almostly.

A better approach is that, to jump over the number which has been scanned, no matter it is part of some solution or not.

If the three numbers formed a solution, we can safely ignore all the duplicates of them.

We can do this to all the three numbers such that we can remove the duplicates. 

Here's my AC C++ Code:


    vector<vector<int> > threeSum(vector<int> &num) {
        
        vector<vector<int> > res;

        std::sort(num.begin(), num.end());

        for (int i = 0; i < num.size(); i++) {
            
            int target = -num[i];
            int front = i + 1;
            int back = num.size() - 1;

            while (front < back) {

                int sum = num[front] + num[back];
                
                // Finding answer which start from number num[i]
                if (sum < target)
                    front++;

                else if (sum > target)
                    back--;

                else {
                    vector<int> triplet = {num[i], num[front], num[back]};
                    res.push_back(triplet);
                    
                    // Processing duplicates of Number 2
                    // Rolling the front pointer to the next different number forwards
                    while (front < back && num[front] == triplet[1]) front++;

                    // Processing duplicates of Number 3
                    // Rolling the back pointer to the next different number backwards
                    while (front < back && num[back] == triplet[2]) back--;
                }
                
            }

            // Processing duplicates of Number 1
            while (i + 1 < num.size() && num[i + 1] == num[i]) 
                i++;

        }
        
        return res;
        
    }


Python Solution:
``` python
Language: python
def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:

	res = set()

	#1. Split nums into three lists: negative numbers, positive numbers, and zeros
	n, p, z = , , 
	for num in nums:
		if num > 0:
			p.append(num)
		elif num < 0: 
			n.append(num)
		else:
			z.append(num)

	#2. Create a separate set for negatives and positives for O(1) look-up times
	N, P = set(n), set(p)

	#3. If there is at least 1 zero in the list, add all cases where -num exists in N and num exists in P
	#   i.e. (-3, 0, 3) = 0
	if z:
		for num in P:
			if -1*num in N:
				res.add((-1*num, 0, num))

	#3. If there are at least 3 zeros in the list then also include (0, 0, 0) = 0
	if len(z) >= 3:
		res.add((0,0,0))

	#4. For all pairs of negative numbers (-3, -1), check to see if their complement (4)
	#   exists in the positive number set
	for i in range(len(n)):
		for j in range(i+1,len(n)):
			target = -1*(n[i]+n[j])
			if target in P:
				res.add(tuple(sorted([n[i],n[j],target])))

	#5. For all pairs of positive numbers (1, 1), check to see if their complement (-2)
	#   exists in the negative number set
	for i in range(len(p)):
		for j in range(i+1,len(p)):
			target = -1*(p[i]+p[j])
			if target in N:
				res.add(tuple(sorted([p[i],p[j],target])))

	return res

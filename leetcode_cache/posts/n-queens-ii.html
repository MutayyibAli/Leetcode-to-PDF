Cpp Solution:
**UPVOTE IF HELPFUL**
We first create a **( n X n )** chess board and assign **0** to every index.
Whenever a queen will be placed, index will be made **1**.

In this approach ,

Whenever a queen is placed, at first it is checked if it satisfies the conditions given that it is not under attack.

**validMove** function.
First it check there are no other queen in row the queen is filled.
As we are putting queen column wise so no need to check for column.
Then there are two diagonals to check for.
* **COLUMN_WISE** FILLING = Only left part of the diagonals are checked as positions to the right of the present column are still unfilled.
*  **ROW_WISE** FILLING = Only upper part of the diagonals are checked as positions below of the present column are still unfilled.

If conditions satisfied, Queen is placed and we move to next column.
If no queen satisfy the problem, we backtrack and try to change the position of previous queen.

Python Solution:
The idea here is quite similar to [N-Queens ][1] while we don't need to record the path, and as the return value is a number not a list, it's better to use a global variable to record the result.
       
    def totalNQueens(self, n):
        self.res = 0
        self.dfs([-1]*n, 0)
        return self.res
        
    def dfs(self, nums, index):
        if index == len(nums):
            self.res += 1
            return #backtracking
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            nums[index] = i
            if self.valid(nums, index):
                self.dfs(nums, index+1)
        
    def valid(self, nums, n):
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] == nums[n] or abs(nums[n]-nums[i]) == n-i:
                return False
        return True

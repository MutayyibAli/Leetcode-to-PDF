# Approach

Let's think about this example.
``` 
s = "abcdefghi", numRows = 4
``` 
In this case, we put the characters of `s` like this.

``` 
1 a     g → ag
2 b   f h → bfh
3 c e   i → cei
4 d       → d
``` 
``` 
return "agbfhceid"
``` 

## What we should do?

---

⭐️ Points
- Put characters on zigzag path
- Create strings horizontally
---

### Put characters on zigzag path
Seems like tough because we move diagonally but it's very simple.
``` 
s = "abcdefghi", numRows = 4
``` 
In this case
``` 
"abcdefghi"
 123432123 (= row)
``` 
All we have to do is that we just move up and down. **More precisely, if we reach `numsRows - 1`, we move up next time and if we reach the first row, we move down next time.**

We will creat direction variable to handle moving direction. When we move down, the variable has `1`. On the other hand, when we move up, the variable has `-1`.

### Create strings horizontally
Now we have an array like this.

``` 
1 a     g
2 b   f h
3 c e   i
4 d      
``` 
All we have to do is just to concatenate all characters in the same row. But there is a point here.

---

⭐️ Points

Use 2d array instead of 1d array

---

Why?

That's because if we use 1d array(of course we can solve the question), we have to concatenate all characters in the same row when we add a new character which is $$O(n)$$. We will repeat the process length of `s` times, so that is $$O(n^2)$$. `n` is the length of the string s.

To avoid $$O(n^2)$$, we use 2d array so that we just append a new character to the last position of a target row which is $$O(1)$$.

**This enables us to keep $$O(n)$$ time instead of $$O(^2)$$.**

I put Python code of $$O(n^2)$$ below.

Easy!
Let's see solution codes and step by step algorithm!

    for (let i = 0; i < numRows; i++) {
        rows[i] = rows[i].join('');
    }

    return rows.join('');

            }
        }

        return result;        
    }
};
``` 

## Step by Step Algorithm

1. **Check Special Cases**: 
    - If numRows is 1 or greater than or equal to the length of the input string `s`, it means that the ZigZag pattern will be the same as the input string. In such cases, just return the input string `s` as it is.
    ``` python
    if numRows == 1 or numRows >= len(s):
        return s
    ``` 

2. **Initialization**: 
    - Initialize `idx` to keep track of the current row index, starting from 0, and `d` as the direction of traversal (1 for downward, -1 for upward).
    - Create a list of numRows empty lists to represent the rows of the ZigZag pattern.
    ``` python
    idx, d = 0, 1
    rows = [ for row in range(numRows)]
    ``` 

3. **Traverse through the String**:
    - Iterate through each character `char` in the input string `s`.
    - Append the current character to the row indicated by the `idx`.
    - Update the direction `d` based on the current position (`idx`).
    - Update the current row index `idx` according to the direction `d`.
    ``` python
    for char in s:
        rows[idx].append(char)
        if idx == 0:
            d = 1
        elif idx == numRows - 1:
            d = -1
        idx += d
    ``` 

4. **Join Rows**:
    - Iterate through each row in `rows`.
    - Join the characters in each row to form strings.
    - Update each row in `rows` with the joined string.
    ``` python
    for i in range(numRows):
        rows[i] = ''.join(rows[i])
    ``` 

5. **Join Rows into Result String**:
    - Join all the rows together to form the final ZigZag pattern.
    ``` python
    return ''.join(rows)
    ```

# Bonus

This is $$O(n^2)$$.

``` python
Language: python 
class Solution:
    def convert(self, s: str, numRows: int) -> str:
        if numRows == 1 or numRows >= len(s):
            return s

        idx, d = 0, 1
        rows = [''] * numRows

        for char in s:
            rows[idx] += char
            if idx == 0:
                d = 1
            elif idx == numRows - 1:
                d = -1
            idx += d

        return ''.join(rows)

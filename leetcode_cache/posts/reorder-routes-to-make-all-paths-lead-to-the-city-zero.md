# Solution:
#### Intuition
We can use DFS to traverse the tree and change the direction of edges if needed.

#### Approach
First, we create an adjacency list to represent the tree. Each node in the list contains a list of its neighbors.

To change the direction of edges, we assign a direction to each edge. If an edge goes from node i to node j, we represent it as i -> j. If an edge goes from node j to node i, we represent it as j -> -i.

Then, we start DFS from node 0. We mark visited nodes to avoid revisiting them. If we reach a node i that has not been visited before, it means we need to change the direction of the edge that leads to node i. We do this by adding 1 to the result if the edge is directed from node j to node i (i.e., j -> i), and 0 otherwise (i.e., j -> -i).

We repeat this process until all nodes have been visited.

Finally, we return the total number of edges that we have changed.

#### Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We traverse the tree once using DFS.

- Space complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We use a boolean array to keep track of visited nodes. Also, we use an adjacency list to represent the tree, which requires O(n) space.

<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

Cpp Solution:
This problem is equivalent to detecting a cycle in the directed graph represented by `prerequisites`. Both BFS and DFS can be used to solve it using the idea of **topological sort**. Since `pair<int, int>` is inconvenient for implementing graph algorithms, we first transform it to the adjacency-list representation. If course `u` is a prerequisite of course `v`, then the adjacency list of `u` will contain `v`.

**BFS**

BFS uses the indegrees of each node. We will first try to find a node with `0` indegree. If we fail to do so, there must be a cycle in the graph and we return `false`. Otherwise we set its indegree to be `-1` to prevent from visiting it again and reduce the indegrees of its neighbors by `1`. This process will be repeated for `n` (number of nodes) times.

``` cpp
Language: cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canFinish(int numCourses, vector<pair<int, int>>& prerequisites) {
        graph g = buildGraph(numCourses, prerequisites);
        vector<int> degrees = computeIndegrees(g);
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            int j = 0;
            for (; j < numCourses; j++) {
                if (!degrees[j]) {
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (j == numCourses) {
                return false;
            }
            degrees[j]--;
            for (int v : g[j]) {
                degrees[v]--;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
private:
    typedef vector<vector<int>> graph;
    
    graph buildGraph(int numCourses, vector<pair<int, int>>& prerequisites) {
        graph g(numCourses);
        for (auto p : prerequisites) {
            g[p.second].push_back(p.first);
        }
        return g;
    }
    
    vector<int> computeIndegrees(graph& g) {
        vector<int> degrees(g.size(), 0);
        for (auto adj : g) {
            for (int v : adj) {
                degrees[v]++;
            }
        }
        return degrees;
    }
};
``` 

**DFS**

For DFS, in each visit, we start from a node and keep visiting its neighbors, if at a time we return to a visited node, there is a cycle. Otherwise, start again from another unvisited node and repeat this process. We use `todo` and `done` for nodes to visit and visited nodes.

``` cpp
Language: cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canFinish(int numCourses, vector<pair<int, int>>& prerequisites) {
        graph g = buildGraph(numCourses, prerequisites);
        vector<bool> todo(numCourses, false), done(numCourses, false);
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            if (!done[i] && !acyclic(g, todo, done, i)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
private:
    typedef vector<vector<int>> graph;
    
    graph buildGraph(int numCourses, vector<pair<int, int>>& prerequisites) {
        graph g(numCourses);
        for (auto p : prerequisites) {
            g[p.second].push_back(p.first);
        }
        return g;
    }
    
    bool acyclic(graph& g, vector<bool>& todo, vector<bool>& done, int node) {
        if (todo[node]) {
            return false;
        }
        if (done[node]) {
            return true;
        }
        todo[node] = done[node] = true;
        for (int v : g[node]) {
            if (!acyclic(g, todo, done, v)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        todo[node] = false;
        return true;
    }
};
``` 


Python Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses, prerequisites):
        graph = [ for _ in xrange(numCourses)]
        visit = [0 for _ in xrange(numCourses)]
        for x, y in prerequisites:
            graph[x].append(y)
        def dfs(i):
            if visit[i] == -1:
                return False
            if visit[i] == 1:
                return True
            visit[i] = -1
            for j in graph[i]:
                if not dfs(j):
                    return False
            visit[i] = 1
            return True
        for i in xrange(numCourses):
            if not dfs(i):
                return False
        return True

1. if node `v` has not been visited, then mark it as `0`.
2. if node `v` is being visited, then mark it as `-1`. If we find a vertex marked as `-1` in DFS, then their is a ring.
3. if node `v` has been visited, then mark it as `1`. If a vertex was marked as `1`, then no ring contains `v` or its successors.

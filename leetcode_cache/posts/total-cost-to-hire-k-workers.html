Cpp Solution:

# Intuition:

1. To Intuition is to maintains two priority queues (`pq1` and `pq2`) that store the `candidates` smallest costs from the beginning and end of the list. 
2. In each iteration, the code compares the smallest costs from `pq1` and `pq2` and selects the one with the lowest value. The corresponding cost is added to the total cost (`ans`), and the element is removed from the respective priority queue. 
3. This process continues for `k` iterations, and at the end, the accumulated `ans` value represents the minimum total cost required to hire `k` workers.

# Explanation:

1. Two integer variables `i` and `j` are initialized to track the start and end indices of the `costs` vector, respectively. These indices will be used to iterate over the vector.
2. Two priority queues, `pq1` and `pq2`, are created. Priority queues are data structures that allow efficient insertion and retrieval of elements while maintaining a specific order. In this case, the elements are integers, and the order is ascending (`greater<int>`).
3. A `long long` variable `ans` is initialized to store the total cost.
4. The code enters a loop that executes `k` times, where `k` is the number of workers to be hired.
5. Inside the loop, two nested `while` loops are used to populate `pq1` and `pq2` with candidates from the `costs` vector. The conditions for these loops are as follows:
   - `pq1` should contain at most `candidates` elements, and `i` should be less than or equal to `j`.
   - `pq2` should also contain at most `candidates` elements, and `i` should be less than or equal to `j`.
   These loops essentially fill the priority queues with the smallest `candidates` elements from the `costs` vector, taking elements from both ends of the vector (`i` and `j`).
6. After the `while` loops, the code compares the top elements (`t1` and `t2`) of `pq1` and `pq2` to determine which one is smaller. If both queues are empty, `INT_MAX` (maximum value for an `int`) is used as a placeholder.
7. If `t1` is smaller than or equal to `t2`, the cost of the worker represented by `t1` is added to `ans`, and the top element is removed from `pq1` using `pq1.pop()`. Otherwise, the cost of the worker represented by `t2` is added to `ans`, and the top element is removed from `pq2` using `pq2.pop()`.
8. The loop continues until `k` workers have been hired.
9. Finally, the function returns the accumulated total cost (`ans`).

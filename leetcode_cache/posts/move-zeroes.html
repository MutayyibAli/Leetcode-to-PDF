Cpp Solution:
    class Solution {
    public:
        void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums) {
            int j = 0;
            // move all the nonzero elements advance
            for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
                if (nums[i] != 0) {
                    nums[j++] = nums[i];
                }
            }
            for (;j < nums.size(); j++) {
                nums[j] = 0;
            }
        }
    };


Python Solution:
Hi there! Here is my solution to this problem that uses two pointers technique.

**Code:**
``` 
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: list) -> None:
        slow = 0
        for fast in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[fast] != 0 and nums[slow] == 0:
                nums[slow], nums[fast] = nums[fast], nums[slow]

            # wait while we find a non-zero element to
            # swap with you
            if nums[slow] != 0:
                slow += 1
``` 

**Algorithm complexity:**
*Time complexity: O(n)*. Our fast pointer does not visit the same spot twice.
*Space complexity: O(1)*. All operations are made in-place

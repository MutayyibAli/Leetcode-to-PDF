# Cpp Solution:
This is a vanilla application of Trie. The main difficulty lies in how to deal with the `.` character. I use a naive solution in this place: each time when I reach a `.`, I simply traverse all the children of the current node and recursively search the remaining substring starting from each of those children.

```cpp
class TrieNode {
public:
    bool word;
    TrieNode* children[26];
    TrieNode() {
        word = false;
        memset(children, NULL, sizeof(children));
    }
};

class WordDictionary {
public:
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    WordDictionary() {
        
    }
    
    /** Adds a word into the data structure. */
    void addWord(string word) {
        TrieNode* node = root;
        for (char c : word) {
            if (!node -> children[c - 'a']) {
                node -> children[c - 'a'] = new TrieNode();
            }
            node = node -> children[c - 'a'];
        }
        node -> word = true;
    }
    
    /** Returns if the word is in the data structure. A word could contain the dot character '.' to represent any one letter. */
    bool search(string word) {
        return search(word.c_str(), root);
    }
private:
    TrieNode* root = new TrieNode();
    
    bool search(const char* word, TrieNode* node) {
        for (int i = 0; word[i] && node; i++) {
            if (word[i] != '.') {
                node = node -> children[word[i] - 'a'];
            } else {
                TrieNode* tmp = node;
                for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {
                    node = tmp -> children[j];
                    if (search(word + i + 1, node)) {
                        return true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return node && node -> word;
    }
};
 ```


# Python Solution:
```
What the question is saying, 
We have to design a data structure that supports adding new words and finding if a string matches any previously added string.
```

**So, to design a DS we only need to support 3 function's for this data structure.**

* One is the **constructor** that's gonna intialize the object.
* One is **Adding** the **word's**, but all of them are lower case from **a to z**
* One is **Searching** a **word**, and the word can contains any character from **a - z**. But there is **1 additional character** it contains, **"."** character `[And what they told "." character is a wild card, can match any character easily in the string]`

**The brute force way to solve this problem** is pretty simple, "*having a list of words & then just for every search we would just see, if this search match any of the word in input list*." **[But it's not an efficient way]**

Let's talk about, **efficient way to solve this problem**. And for that we require **Trie data structure** a.k.a **Prefix tree**

Let's understand **Trie first**,
**Trie** is basically a **tree** that has some kind of **root node** & each node can have up to **26 children in this problem**. Because we have **lower case character from a to z**. So, basically each **node represent's a single character**. And each node could have up to 26 additional children:



And basically word in this example means, let's take **"a"** having child **"b" -> with "c"**, so that's will be a **single word**. And if we insert the word **"abc"** in our **trie**, so basically how's it looks like:



One additional thing we have to say is, for a particular node such as **"c"** this is the **end of the word**. Because if we **added another word** example:- **"ab"**. So, we don't add them back again as if you notice they are already available to us, we just **gonna re-use** these characters. So, we have 2 word's along this **path "abc" & "ab"**
Basically, all words start with **"a"** are gonna be here, that's what it make it **efficient**. That's why it's called **prefix tree**.

`Now, you have understood how Trie aka Prefix Tree work.`

Now let's take an example & build our tree,
**Input**
```
["WordDictionary","addWord","addWord","addWord","search","search","search","search"]
[[],["bad"],["dad"],["mad"],["pad"],["bad"],[".ad"],["b.."]]
```
**Output**
```
[null,null,null,null,false,true,true,true]
```
* The first word we add is **"bad". "b" -> "a" -> "d"**

* Next we adding another word **"dad"**. So, we have to start with **different path**. As, these two word's have a **different prefix**. One start with **"b"** and one start with **"d"**. So, let's add it: **"d" -> "a" -> "d"**

* We have one last word before we start searching, this one gonna be **"mad"**. So, we don't have **"m"**, then let's add it: **"m" -> "a" -> "d"**



So far we have **3 word's** and all of them end with different **"d"**. But they all **3 of them have different prefix** that's why they are along different path's.



`Now let's go for searching path:-`

* So, first word we gonna search for **"pad"**. We gonna **start** at **beginning**. First we gonna try are there any **"p"** in this. That means immediately we **return false** as **"pad"** doesn't exist in our input.

* Now, we search another word **"bad"**. So, we **start at the root** and see there are any **"b"**. Yes, we have **"b"**. now we check does this **"b"** have a child **"a"**, yes it does. Now last character **"d"** does **"a"** has a child **"d"**, yes it does have. Lastly we have to say the last character **"d"** is in our **trie**, which designated as the end of the word. Sice it's **marked red**. Therefore, we **return true** for this input **"bad"**


* Now, in this search we have **".ad"**, the dot **"."** character matches any character. So, we start at the root and go to any of the path and to do that we have to use **DFS or backtracking approach**. So, let's say first path we decided **"b"**. now we check does this **"b"** have a child **"a"**, yes it does. Now last character **"d"** does **"a"** has a child **"d"**, yes it does have. Lastly we have to say the last character **"d"** in our trie, is designated as the end of the word. Therefore, we **return true** for this input **".ad"**


* One last search, In this we have **"b.."**. So, we start at the root and see there are any **"b"**. Yes, we have **"b"**. Now we check do we have any character to go below for our current dot **"."**, yes we have **"a"**. Now we are looking for any character for our last **dot "."** Yes we have **"d"** & it is end of the word. Therefore, we **return true** for this input **"b.."**

Now understand this ***VISUALLY, it's not super hard.***




**Now, let's code it up:**

ANALYSIS :-
* **Time Complexity :-** BigO(M) for well defined words, But in worse case BigO(M.26^N)

* **Space Complexity :-** BigO(1) for well defined words, But for worst case BigO(M)

# Approach

If you know Two Sum question that is the first question of LeetCode, you can solve this question with `HashMap`. But `HashMap` solution should $$O(n)$$ space. The description says "Your solution must use only constant extra space", so you need to change your strategy.

Let me explain my strategy with this example.
``` 
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 18
``` 
My strategy is to use two pointers. Let's say `left` and `right`.

``` 
[2,7,11,15]
 L      R
``` 
`left` pointer starts from index `0` and `right` pointer starts from the last index.

Every time we calculate addition with left number + right number.

``` 
[2,7,11,15]
 L      R

2 + 15 = 17 
target = 18
``` 
Now current total (= `17`) is smaller than the target, so current combination is not answer.

After that, we have to move `left` or `right` to find the target number.

But how can we decide to move the one of them? 

It's simple. Current total is smaller than the target, that's why we should move `left` pointer to the next, **because input array is sorted, so right number is definitely greater than left number.** If we move `left` pointer to the next, we will get bigger total next time.

``` 
[2,7,11,15]
   L    R

7 + 15 = 22
target = 18
``` 
We got bigger total this time. In that case, we need to move `right` pointer to the next, because of the same reason above. Input array is sorted, so if we move `right` pointer to the next, we will get smaller total next time.

``` 
[2,7,11,15]
   L R

7 + 11 = 18
target = 18
``` 
Now, current total is equal to the target. The description says "Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2".

``` 
return [2, 3]
``` 

Easy! 
Let's see a real algorithm!

# Step by Step Algorithm

1. **Initialize Pointers**:
   - Set `left` pointer to the start of the array, i.e., index 0.

     ``` python
     left = 0
     ``` 
   - Set `right` pointer to the end of the array, i.e., index `len(numbers) - 1`.

     ``` python
     right = len(numbers) - 1
     ``` 

2. **Loop Until Pointers Meet**:
   - Enter a `while` loop that continues until the `left` pointer is less than the `right` pointer.

     ``` python
     while left < right:
     ``` 

3. **Calculate Sum**:
   - Calculate the sum of the elements at indices `left` and `right` in the `numbers` array and store it in the variable `total`.

     ``` python
     total = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
     ``` 

4. **Check Sum Against Target**:
   - Check if the `total` sum equals the `target` value.

     ``` python
     if total == target:
     ``` 
     - If it does, return an array containing the indices `left + 1` and `right + 1`. These indices are incremented by 1 to convert them to 1-indexed format as mentioned in the problem statement.

       ``` python
       return [left + 1, right + 1]
       ``` 
     - If not, proceed to the next steps.

5. **Adjust Pointers**:
   - If the `total` sum is greater than the `target`, decrement the `right` pointer. This indicates that we need to decrease the sum, so we move towards smaller values by decreasing the index of the right pointer.

     ``` python
     elif total > target:
         right -= 1
     ``` 
   - If the `total` sum is less than the `target`, increment the `left` pointer. This indicates that we need to increase the sum, so we move towards larger values by increasing the index of the left pointer.

     ``` python
     else:
         left += 1
     ``` 

6. **Repeat**:
   - Repeat steps 3-5 until either the condition `left < right` becomes false, or a valid pair summing up to the target is found.

7. **Return Default Value**:
   - If no valid pair summing up to the target is found within the array, return an array containing `-1, -1` as there is no solution.

     ``` python
     return [-1, -1]
     ``` 

This algorithm efficiently finds a pair of indices in the given sorted array `numbers` whose elements sum up to the given `target`. It utilizes a two-pointer approach to navigate through the array and converge towards the target sum.

# Approaches
(Also explained in the code)

1. **Common Prefix Identification:**

    - The function iteratively right-shifts both `left` and `right` until they become equal, identifying the common prefix of their binary representations.
1. **Counting Shifts:**

    - It counts the number of right-shifts performed, storing the count in the variable `cnt`.
1. **Bitwise AND Calculation:**

    - After finding the common prefix, it reconstructs the bitwise AND result by left-shifting the common prefix by `cnt` bits.

``` left_
Language: left_=5_and_right_=7 
Lets manually apply & operation on all elements present in the 
range 5 and 7 including themself.

            5 = 101
            6 = 110
            7 = 111

AND operations:
            0 & 0 = 0
            0 & 1 = 0
            1 & 0 = 0
            1 & 1 = 1

With the help of above operations lets perform AND operations.

            101(5) & 110(6) = 100(4)

            100(4) & 111(7) = 100(4)

    answer = 4


Now lets apply the method used in the code:

we will remove last digit from binary representation of both left
and right number until we reach a point where both have same 
element at the same position.
And will also keep track of how many times we removed elements 
by keeping a count of it.

lets apply it practically:

first loop:
            101 >> 1 = 10
            111 >> 1 = 11
            cnt = 1

Second loop:
            10 >> 1 = 1
            11 >> 1 = 1
            cnt = 2

Third loop:
            1 == 1 
So now since they are equal we will add those many 0's at the 
end of the current element we have by using left shift operator.

            1 << cnt  = 1 << 2  => 100(4) 


    Result = 4




``` 
.
``` NOTE
Language: NOTE 
In both right and left shift, elements will be removed and added 
from the last only.
```

<div><h2 class='question-title'>Max Consecutive Ones III</h2><p><strong>Leetcode No: </strong><a href='https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii'>1004</a> | <strong>Difficulty: </strong>Medium | <strong>Tags:</strong> Array, Binary Search, Sliding Window, Prefix Sum</p><p>Given a binary array <code>nums</code> and an integer <code>k</code>, return <em>the maximum number of consecutive </em><code>1</code><em>&#39;s in the array if you can flip at most</em> <code>k</code> <code>0</code>&#39;s.</p>


<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 6
<strong>Explanation:</strong> [1,1,1,0,0,<u><strong>1</strong>,1,1,1,1,<strong>1</strong></u>]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> 10
<strong>Explanation:</strong> [0,0,<u>1,1,<strong>1</strong>,<strong>1</strong>,1,1,1,<strong>1</strong>,1,1</u>,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
</pre>


<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>nums[i]</code> is either <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.</li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= k &lt;= nums.length</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hints:</strong></p><ul class='hints'><li>One thing's for sure, we will only flip a zero if it extends an existing window of 1s. Otherwise, there's no point in doing it, right? Think Sliding Window!</li><li>Since we know this problem can be solved using the sliding window construct, we might as well focus in that direction for hints. Basically, in a given window, we can never have > K zeros, right?</li><li>We don't have a fixed size window in this case. The window size can grow and shrink depending upon the number of zeros we have (we don't actually have to flip the zeros here!).</li><li>The way to shrink or expand a window would be based on the number of zeros that can still be flipped and so on.</li></ul></div>
